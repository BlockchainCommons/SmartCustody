# Blockchain Commons SmartCustody

### _by Christopher Allen and Shannon Appelcline_

**SmartCustody** is an educational project intended to encourage responsible key management for digital assets. It includes a book focused on risk modeling and digital custody scenarios as well as a number of shorter papers that focus on individual "smart" methodologies for managing digital custody, such as multisigs and sharded shares.

## The SmartCustody Book

* [#SmartCustody 1.01](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook) (July 2019) — Original book on how to model your risks and maintain the safety of your digital assets (released). Also see the original [GitHub files](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook).
   * [#SmartCustody 2.0 Plans](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md) — Outline & notes for revision & expansion.

## SmartCustody Scenarios

We've recently supplemented the Cold-Storage scenario found in #SC 1.01 with a new multisig scenario:

* [Multisig Self-Custody Scenario](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md) (April 2022) — _Draft_ of a specific scenario for multisig, currently seeking feedback on the overall thinking. Will be expanded in the future to support more signing devices and even transaction coordinators.
 
## SmartCustody Tools

The following long-form essays describe how to use a variety of smart tools to improve the resilience and security of your digital assets.

***Multisigs:***
* [Designing Multisig for Indepedence & Resilience](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md) (March 2021) - Design process & sample multisigs (released).

***SSKR Shares:***
* [Designing SSKR Share Scenarios](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md) (August 2021) - How to manage SSKR shares (preliminary)
* [The Dangers of Secret-Sharing Schemes](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md) (August 2021) - How secret-sharing can be subverted (preliminary)

***Timelocks:***
* [Using Timelocks to Protect Digital Assets](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md) (July 2021) - Using Timelocks (very preliminary).

## SmartCustody Case Studies

Analyses of how professional apps and hardware devices accomodate [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/README.md#gordian-principles) and defeat SmartCustody adversaries.

* [Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Studies-Overview.md) — Details of case study criteria.
   * [Blockchain Commons Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-SeedTool.md) — Airgapped Hardware Wallet.
   * [Foundation Devices Passport](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md) — Airgapped Hardware Wallet.
   * [Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md) — Software Wallet & Transaction Coordinator.

## SmartCustody Best Practices

The following smaller topics are simple suggesting for maintaing robust security.

* [SmartCustody Practices](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Practices.md)
   * [Separate Seeds from Keys](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Practices.md#separate-seeds--keys)

## Gordian Apps

All of the [Gordian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) apps are SmartCustody apps, because they highlight the Gordian Principles, including resilience. They also tend to use SmartCustody tools such as multisigs and SSKR. However, some are of particular note, because they're also built to solve very specific SmartCustody problems.

* [mori-cli](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli) — A miniscript-based app that uses timelocks to ensure the continuity of funds following death or incapacitation.
 
## Gordian Principles

**SmartCustody** displays how to use the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology, to ensure responsible key management.

* **Independence.** SmartCustody suggests self-sovereign scenarios, where you control your keys.
* **Privacy.** A minor element of SmartCustody, privacy should innately develop from the independent scenarios.
* **Resilience.** SmartCustody combats two major problems: it makes sure keys aren't lost or stolen.
* **Openness.** The procedures of SmartCustody use standard, non-proprietary methods, such as multisigs, timelocks, and Shamir's Secret Sharing.

## Status - Ongoing

**SmartCustody** is an ongoing process. See the individual descriptions of books and articles.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
